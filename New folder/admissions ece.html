<h1>What is unique about our BTech Electronics & Communication Engineering (ECE) Admission Process?</h1>
<p>At NU, it is important for us to find the right students and we also believe that it is important for the students to find the right institution. We believe that the parent/guardian forms the crucial third pillar without whom the process of selection would remain incomplete. Hence we have devised, what we believe is, an apt admission process that gives an opportunity for the students as well as their parents/guardians to engage with us.</p>

<p>The process of BTech Electronics & Communication Engineering (ECE) admission is called Admission Interaction Process or AIP for short. The AIP consists of three parts.</p>
<ol><p>
<li>Admission Interaction Process (AIP) (show in a flowchart)</li>

<li>Questionnaire stating student’s aspirations and reasons for choosing BTech Electronics & Communication Engineering as a career option</li>

<li>The applicant will appear for NUET which is conducted by NU for admission to its Technology Programmes. It consists of questions drawn from Physics/ Chemistry/ Mathematics and/or Biology</li></p>
</ol>

<p>The applicants will undergo the Personal Counseling Interaction (PCI) either face-to-face or through video conferencing.</p>

<p>The following will be assessed during the PCI:</p>
<h2><p>
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" style="font-size:20px"> English communication skills – written & oral</i><br>
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" style="font-size:20px"> Interest & hobbies</i><br>
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" style="font-size:20px"> Degree of self-awareness</i><br>
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" style="font-size:20px"> Out-of-the-box thinking</i><br>
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" style="font-size:20px"> Reason for the choice of stream</i><br>
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" style="font-size:20px"> Behavior and attitude</i><br>
<i class="fa fa-angle-right" style="font-size:20px"> Overall personality</i></h2></p><br><br>

<p>NU also believes that due weightage and recognition should be given to the academic learning the student has undergone even before taking up B Tech admission. Hence multiple components of academics including class X performance, class XII performance and performance in a recognized engineering entrance tests are considered.</p>
